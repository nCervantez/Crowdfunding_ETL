# **Extract, Transform, and Load - Mini Project**

## Project Overview
Welcome to the ETL project. This collaboartive effort aims to showcase proper ETL on a data set, to later be added into a database with corresponding tables.

Project Members:

- Cory Selzer - Creating a contacts CSV using list comprehension.

- Induja Mohandas - Category and Subcategory CSV using numpy arrays.

- Nathaniel Cervantez - SQL database Schema and Data Loading.

- Shail Desai - Campaign dataframe and CSV file.

## Project Goals

Extract: We will pull the data from the crowdfunding CSV by reading it into a dataframe with Pandas.

Transfrom: We will use pandas, numpy and python to create seperate data frames with the desired information, and alter the data to follow the third normal form (3NF).

Load - We will load the data into a database with corresponding tables for each CSV created during the transform portion of the project.
